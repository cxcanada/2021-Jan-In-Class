## Introduction to Visual Studio

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- Define the term IDE: **Integrated Development Environment**
- List the key tools available in Visual Studio
  - Editor with intellisense
  - Debugger
  - Compiler & Runtime execution
  - "Solution Explorer" - Manage the projects/file that part of your solution
    - Shows a "logical" representation of the things in the whole solution
- Describe the relationship between Solutions, Projects and Files in Visual Studio
  - The `.sln` (solution file) lists the projects in a solution.
  - Each project will list the files/settings for the project in its `.csproj` file.
- List three different types of projects in Visual Studio
  - Console application - The compiled program has the extension of `.exe` - this program a `Main()` method
  - Web Applications - In the .NET Framework 4.x, the web application does not have a "single-file" output. Rather the C# code is compiled into one `.dll` and all the other "web" parts are kept as individual file. Web applications are run inside of/by a **Web Server**
  - Class Libraries - The compiled project has a `.dll` extension - Dynamically Linked Library - they have LOTS of Classes
- List three different web site templates in Visual Studio
- Describe the following parts of the Visual Studio IDE: Editor Window, Toolbox, Solution Explorer, Server Explorer, Error List, Output Window
- Identify the file extension for a Solution file
- Identify the file extension for a CSharp Project file
- Create a Asp.NET Web Application Project
- Create a Class Library project
- Create a blank solution
- Configure the tool options in Visual Studio

- Describe the difference between variables, values and data types.
- Explain what is meant by a "literal value".
- Explain what a "keyword" is in any programming language.
- Define the phrase "intrinsic data type".
- List the data types that are built into the course's programming language and the default values for those data types.
- Explain what an assignment statement is and how it works.
- Explain what an "expression" is in any programming language.

- Identify and describe the syntax of the statements associated with the five logical programming structures in the course's programming language.
- List the relational and logical operators in the course's programming language.
- Identify the entry point for every computer program.
- Create a simple console program with functions and subroutines.
- Perform simple console I/O.
- Manipulate information with variables, values and expressions.
- Create code using the five logical programming structures.
- Create code for multi-structured logic (logic that includes many nested and stacked structures)
